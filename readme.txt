== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**What will the plugin do?**

The QOTZ.net quotes plugin will retrieve a random quote from our own Qotz.net API and display the data anywhere on your website.

**I can't see shortcode in my WordPress sidebar. What should I do?**

There's an option to uncomment a single line at the bottom of the qotz.php file that'll enable shortcodes in widgets. Additional information is available on our support website.

**What are the plans for the future?**

We plan on implementing a large number of improvements. They include:

* TV and movie quotes.
* Additional formatting options.
* Request quote based on specific keywords or type of quote (history, politics, comedy, individual, gender etc.)
* Cache more quotes locally and rotate them more often.
